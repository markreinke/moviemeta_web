<h1><b>Welcome to Project Moviemeta!</b></h1>
<br> 
<h3><b>Intro</b></h3>
<p> Do you like movies? What kind of movies do you like? Hollywood blockbuster or independent film? Say that we are a start-up film maker and looking for 'target' countries from which our new films would get big profit.What can we do first to get insights on the target market? We should do researches on <b>how diverse the movie topics are and how does socio-political or historical background affect the topics of movies</b>. In other words, investigation on <b>popular topics across the world</b> should give some insights for us. Here, we'll describe some interesting results of the topic analyses on movies across the world. Hope you enjoy and make interesting findings here! </p>
<br>
<h3><b>Data Source</b></h3>
<p>- moive metadata from IMDb(www.imdb.com) since 2000<br>
- movie metadata from wikipedia(www.dbpedia.org)<br>
- box office top movies from Box Office Mojo(www.boxofficemojo.com) since 2007<br></p>

<h3> <b>What are the popular movie topics across several movie-loving countries?</b></h3>
<p>Topics of popular movies is an important indicator of interests or issues of a society, because making and selecting movie are inevitably affected by social, political, and historical background. To answer our question, 2,400 popular movie plots for United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Russia, Mexico, and South Korea were analyzed since 2007(50 popular movies per year, per country). Popularity of a topic can be represented by prevalency of that topic in each movie.
Global popular topics represent the 'overall' popularity of topics across the 6 countries. As we can see in the following chart, topic of  <b>'love, relationships'</b> is the most popular, along with <b>'love, family', 'exploration, nature, space', 'friendship, relationships', and 'society, culture'</b>. 
Interestingly, 3 out of top 5 topics represent 'relationship' with others(love, family, friendship), indicating that the 'relationship' is in the heart of our life. Prevalent words for each topics, such as love, woman, friend, marriage, wife, father, and mother, also indicate that relationship with family, friend, and spouse is a utmost important issues. Regardless of the limited number of popular movies, we could find a wide spectrum of topics, from 'love, relationship' to 'war', 'terrorism', and 'press, politics'. </p>

<h3><b> Are there any differences in popular topics across countries?</b></h3>
<p>Comparing popular topic distribution across 6 countries(<i>click the square box "Country-wise Global Top 10 Topic Distribution</i> in above chart), we could see that the popularity of different topics is quite similar across the countries. It may be because considerable number of top movies in those countries are overlapped each other. One interesting difference was noticed for South Korea: the most popular topic in South Kroea is 'exploration, nature, space', while 'love, relationship' is the most popular in the other countries. Further detailed analyses should be required to get the origin of this uniqueness of South Korea, but it clearly shows the South Korean moviegoers' preference toward the topic. </p><br>
<br>
<h3>Are there any differences in movie topics produced in different countries(origin of movies)?</h3>
<p>To get more insights from the popular topics and topic distribution, we addressed a different view point: <b></b>"Origin of Movies"</b>. If topics of movies produced in a specific country(for example, South Korea) are concentrated on some particular topics(for example, 'crime, mystery'), it can be interpreted as a result of 'preference', 'taste' or 'socio-political interests' in that country. If we can get geographical distribution of movie topics by origin of movies, it should give us a more clear insights on deciding where to proceed. Thus, we performed analyses on topic distribution by origin of movies across about 70 countries in the world. </p>
